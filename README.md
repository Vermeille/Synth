# Synth

This is a synthesizer. It outputs sounds on stdout, so to hear what it actually plays, just do

    ./synth | aplay -f S16_LE -c2 -r44100

Since I'm not interested at all in making it useful, there's absolutely no way to make it play what you want. Just edit the main, code your song in it and recompile.
